# Income and Life Expectancy Analysis
A UC Berkeley **ECON148: Data Science for Economists** project.

### Introduction
This project focuses on these two research questions:
1) What effect does income have on life expectancy for males and females?
2) How does life expectancy differ between the top 25% and bottom 25%?

The purpose of this project is to investigate the relationship between socioeconomic inequality and health disparity through prediction models that assess the impact of income on life expectancy for both males and females. Additionally, we aim to analyze how the health conditions differ between the top 25% and the bottom 25% income group and the correlation of that with life expectancy. Through this research, we hope to identify any significant disparities that exist between the different income groups and potential solutions as increasing life expectancy disparities can lead to a range of social and economical problems.

**Skill sets applied in this project include:**
- Designing a data science project from scratch.
- Using `Python` and `Pandas` to explore the data, clean it, and analyze it.
